# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:\n$n^2 + n + 41$\nIt turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \\le n \\le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41.\nThe incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \\le n \\le 79$. The product of the coefficients, \xe2\x88\x9279 and 1601, is \xe2\x88\x92126479.\nConsidering quadratics of the form:\n\n$n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| < 1000$ and $|b| \\le 1000$where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$\n\nFind the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.'
